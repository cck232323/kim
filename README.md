the Python files server.py and client.py play pivotal roles in realizing the functional requirements of the messaging and video talk application, akin to Messenger and WhatsApp.

server.py: This file likely encapsulates the server-side logic of the application. It is responsible for handling client connections, managing user authentication, and routing messages. Given the assignment's specifications, the server script would handle various commands related to private messaging, group chats, and broadcasting messages. It should maintain the state and information of all active users, handle concurrent client connections, manage group chat functionalities, and ensure proper message delivery and logout processes. Error handling, TCP communication, and possibly UDP handling for video streaming are key components.

client.py: On the other hand, this file is expected to implement the client-side logic. It should provide an interface for users to send commands to the server, like sending private or broadcast messages, creating or joining group chats, and uploading or downloading video streams. The client script needs to handle user inputs, display messages and active users, and manage the user's session. It must establish and maintain a TCP connection with the server, handle responses and messages from the server, and provide a user-friendly interface for various messaging functionalities.

Both scripts are crucial for the assignment, requiring a robust understanding of network programming, particularly the TCP/IP protocol for reliable communication. The client and server scripts must work cohesively to ensure a seamless user experience, adhering to the custom application protocols and functionality as outlined in the assignment brief. Students are expected to thoroughly test these scripts to ensure they meet the specified requirements, including handling different user scenarios and network conditions.
